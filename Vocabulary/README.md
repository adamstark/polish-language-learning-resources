# Polish-English Vocabulary CSV Files

I have shared here some vocabulary lists that I have built during my time learning Polish. I created these lists by hand based on what I encountered, read, heard and wanted to cement in my mind.

I recommend learning words like this in a spaced-repetition app like [Wokabulary](https://wokabulary.com/).

## Read this first

IMPORTANT: Before using these files, please understand a few things...

1. These words are not curated as an ideal list for a learner, they are just "what I encountered on my language-learning journey"
2. Some of the more "beginner" words may be missing, as I curated these lists after beginning learning Polish
3. Sometimes a word has multiple meanings, and I have often opted to go for the most common one in the hope I will later learn the others.

## Notes on Lists

### Verb Aspect Pairs

These are verbs in their aspectual pairs - i.e. Imperfective / Perfective + a translation.

E.g.

| Polish  | English |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| jeść / zjeść  | to eat  |
| kupować / kupić | to buy |
| pisać / napisać  | to write |

Learning these in pairs helps me keep in mind what to do when I need to use different aspects.

### Adjectives

These are adjectives I have found useful whilst learning Polish
