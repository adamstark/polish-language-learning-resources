# Polish Language Learning Resources

This is a collection of useful links and resources that I have been using to learn Polish. I hope they can help someone! If you have some suggestions to add please feel free to contribute via a pull request. 

I've put a ⭐ by the things I use the most, in case that helps guide you. But I've only included useful resources here so do check out everything.

## Dictionaries / Translators

I use a range of different sites for translating words. It would be nice if there was just a single go-to resource, but some are very reliable in their translations but only accept certain word forms (e.g. verb infinitives) while others will take any word and provide a translation but are sometimes less reliable in their answers. Often I use one to find a root form (e.g. from conjugated verb to a verb infinitive) and then another to get a translation I am happy with. 

* [Cambridge Polish–English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/polish-english/) ⭐
* [Wielki słownik języka polskiego](https://wsjp.pl/) 
* [WordReference.com Słownik polsko-angielski](https://www.wordreference.com/plen/) 
* [Cooljugator](https://cooljugator.com/pl) ⭐
* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=pl&tl=en&op=translate) ⭐
* [iTranslate](https://itranslate.com/) - I use their app on my Mac toolbar for convenience ⭐

## YouTube Channels

Some very useful channels that range from lessons to cultural interviews. Some are simple grammar explanations and some are more like 'comprehensible input' materials.

* [EasyPolish](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyPolish) (my favourite, highly recommend!) ⭐
* [Polish with Dorota](https://www.youtube.com/@PolishwithDorota)
* [Polish with Monika](https://www.youtube.com/@PolishwithMonika)
* [Polish with Blondes](https://www.youtube.com/@polishwithblondes)

## Vocab Learning Apps

I started with Duolingo, as I'm sure many of you have. As I needed to move further with the language I've found I needed ways to manage vocabulary outside of Duolingo too.

* [Wokabulary](https://wokabulary.com) - a brilliant vocab app for Apple platforms, I use it daily ⭐
* [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)
* [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)
  
## Vocabulary Lists

* [easy-polish.com](https://easy-polish.com/en/) - many vocabulary lists (FYI, I think this is different to the EasyPolish channel mentioned above)
* [surfacelanguages.com - Polish Sentences](https://www.surfacelanguages.com/sentences/polishsentences.html#phrases)

## Grammar Explainers

Below are some links to resources - right now wholly from the [Clozemaster Blog](https://blog.clozemaster.com/topics/learn-polish/) and their [grammar explainers](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/topics/learn-polish/polish-grammar/) that I have found really useful. There are many more useful posts on their blog, but these ones I've gone back to again and again. They are **in depth**, so don't expect to understand everything with a single read. But they are very comprehensive and clear.

* [Clozemaster: Polish Verbs of Motion “iść”, “jechać”, and Other Related Verbs](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/polish-verbs-of-motion/)
* [Clozemaster: Making Sense of Polish Personal Pronouns](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/polish-personal-pronouns/)
* [Clozemaster: Everything You Need to Know about Polish Prepositions](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/polish-prepositions/)
