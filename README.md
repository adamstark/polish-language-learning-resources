# Polish Language Learning Resources

This is a collection of useful links and resources that I have been using to learn Polish. I hope they can help someone! If you have some suggestions to add please feel free to contribute via a pull request. 

I've put a ‚≠ê by the things I use the most, in case that helps guide you. But I've only included useful resources here so do check out everything.

## Dictionaries / Translators

I use a range of different sites for translating words. It would be nice if there was just a single go-to resource, but some are very reliable in their translations but only accept certain word forms (e.g. verb infinitives) while others will take any word and provide a translation but are sometimes less reliable in their answers. Often I use one to find a root form (e.g. from conjugated verb to a verb infinitive) and then another to get a translation I am happy with. 

* [Cambridge Polish‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/polish-english/) ‚≠ê
* [Wielki s≈Çownik jƒôzyka polskiego](https://wsjp.pl/) 
* [WordReference.com S≈Çownik polsko-angielski](https://www.wordreference.com/plen/) 
* [Cooljugator](https://cooljugator.com/pl) ‚≠ê
* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=pl&tl=en&op=translate) ‚≠ê
* [iTranslate](https://itranslate.com/) - I use their app on my Mac toolbar for convenience ‚≠ê

## YouTube Channels

Some very useful channels that range from lessons to cultural interviews. Some are simple grammar explanations and some are more like 'comprehensible input' materials.

* [EasyPolish](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyPolish) (my favourite, highly recommended!) ‚≠ê
* [Polish with Dorota](https://www.youtube.com/@PolishwithDorota)
* [Polish with Monika](https://www.youtube.com/@PolishwithMonika)
* [Polish with Blondes](https://www.youtube.com/@polishwithblondes)

## Vocab Learning Apps

I started with Duolingo, as I'm sure many of you have. As I needed to move further with the language I've found I needed ways to manage vocabulary outside of Duolingo too.

* [Wokabulary](https://wokabulary.com) - a brilliant vocab app for Apple platforms, I use it daily ‚≠ê
* [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)
* [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)
  
## Vocabulary Lists

* [easy-polish.com](https://easy-polish.com/en/) - many vocabulary lists (I _believe_ this is different to the EasyPolish channel mentioned above)
* [surfacelanguages.com - Polish Sentences](https://www.surfacelanguages.com/sentences/polishsentences.html#phrases)

## Grammar Explainers

Below are some links to resources - right now wholly from the [Clozemaster Blog](https://blog.clozemaster.com/topics/learn-polish/) and their [grammar explainers](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/topics/learn-polish/polish-grammar/) (‚≠ê) that I have found really useful. There are many more useful posts on their blog, but these ones I've gone back to again and again. They are **in depth**, so don't expect to understand everything with a single read. But they are very comprehensive and clear.

* [Clozemaster: Polish Verbs of Motion ‚Äúi≈õƒá‚Äù, ‚Äújechaƒá‚Äù, and Other Related Verbs](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/polish-verbs-of-motion/)
* [Clozemaster: Making Sense of Polish Personal Pronouns](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/polish-personal-pronouns/)
* [Clozemaster: Everything You Need to Know about Polish Prepositions](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/polish-prepositions/)

## Courses

I've only taken one course, which is the [EasyPolish](https://www.easypolish.org/courses) course (same as the YouTube listed channel above). I have found it really valuable and it has helped me immensely.

Other courses are available and I am sure they are great too, but I can't really recommend something I have no experience of.

## Podcasts

* [Learn Real Polish](https://realpolish.pl/) - Lots of other great audio material on the site too
  
## Other Advice

1. Go to Poland, meet polish people, eat polish food and drink polish beer!
2. Marry a Pole üòâ
3. Don't be disheartened... it's pretty easy to feel overwhelmed by the language (it is _wildly_ complicated... Poles often tell me how sorry they are that I will have to learn so many rules / endings). But the rules and grammar forms do eventually become more natural with practice, after which _not_ adding the correct ending just "feels wrong". First you learn the rules, but later you have to _internalise_ them through exposure, reading, speaking, listening, being corrected by others. Just accept you're going to get it wrong for a while and power through!
4. Duolingo is a great introduction to a language, but know when it is time to add other materials too
5. Read, particularly [graded readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_reader)
6. Your brain won't remember anything it doesn't consider valuable. That's a good thing. But it means that you can't just learn vocabulary lists - you need to hear the word in conversations, YouTube videos, read it in books, etc. Send signals to your brain that it should remember the word more deeply.
7. Learn vocabulary... it's good just have an app (I use [Wokabulary](https://wokabulary.com)) and just keep throwing words into it every time you encounter them and think you should know them. E.g. I'll read a book chapter and underline the words I don't know (quickly translating as I go to get the meaning). Then I go back a second time and put (most of) those words into my vocab app.
8. Don't be afraid of material that's a little more advanced than your current language level. Try and understand what you can and the unknown words and language structure will quietly register itself somewhere in your brain.
9. Do at least a little bit of learning every day, sometimes more... If you're tired and can't read books or learn vocab & grammar, just watch an [EasyPolish](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyPolish) video on YouTube
