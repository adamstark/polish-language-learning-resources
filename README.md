# Polish Language Learning Resources

This is a collection of useful links and resources that I have been using to learn Polish. I hope they can help someone! If you have some suggestions to add please feel free to contribute via a pull request. 

## Dictionaries / Translators

I use a range of different sites for translating words. It would be nice if there was just a single go-to resource, but some are very reliable in their translations but only accept certain word forms (e.g. verb infinitives) while others will take any word and provide a translation but are sometimes less reliable in their answers. Often I use one to find a root form (e.g. from conjugated verb to a verb infinitive) and then another to get a reliable translation.

## YouTube Channels

Some very useful channels that range from lessons to cultural interviews. Some are simple grammar explanations and some are more like 'comprehensible input' materials.
